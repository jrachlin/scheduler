MUST HAVE:
*. Do CANCEL function: propagate cancel or accept. Timeout?
*. Limit to N processes

NICE TO HAVE:
*. Add advanced schedule (cron) syntax (e.g. every 5 minutes)
*. Is there a better way to launch the script?  other than exec(open(script.py)) ??

FINALIZING
*. Ensure logging (logger) calls use %s instead of {}
